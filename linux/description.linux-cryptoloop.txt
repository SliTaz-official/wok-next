Cryptoloop Support

Use this package if you want to be able to use the ciphers that are provided by
the CryptoAPI as loop transformation. This might be used as hard disk
encryption.

WARNING: This device is not safe for journaled file systems like ext3 or
Reiserfs. Please use the Device Mapper crypto module instead, which can be
configured to be on-disk compatible with the cryptoloop device.
