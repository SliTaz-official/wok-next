# Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)

ATM is a high-speed networking technology for Local Area Networks and Wide Area
Networks. It uses a fixed packet size and is connection oriented, allowing for
the negotiation of minimum bandwidth requirements.

In order to participate in an ATM network, your Linux box needs an ATM
networking card. Note that you need a set of user-space programs to actually
make use of ATM.
