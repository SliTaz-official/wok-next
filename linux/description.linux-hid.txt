# HID support

A human interface device (HID) is a type of computer device that interacts
directly with and takes input from humans. The term "HID" most commonly used to
refer to the USB-HID specification, but other devices (such as, but not
strictly limited to, Bluetooth) are designed using HID specification (this
involves certain keyboards, mice, tablets, etc). This option adds the HID bus
to the kernel, together with generic HID layer code. The HID devices are added
and removed from the HID bus by the transport-layer drivers, such as usbhid
(USB_HID) and hidp (BT_HIDP).
