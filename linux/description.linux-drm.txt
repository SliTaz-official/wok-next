# Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support)

Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) introduced
in XFree86 4.0. These modules provide support for synchronization, security,
and DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more details.
You should also select and configure AGP (/dev/agpgart) support if it is
available for your platform.
