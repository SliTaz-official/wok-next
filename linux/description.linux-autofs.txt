The automounter is a tool to automatically mount remote file systems on demand.
This implementation is partially kernel-based to reduce overhead in the
already-mounted case; this is unlike the BSD automounter (amd), which is a pure
user space daemon.

To use the automounter you need the user-space tools from
<ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/v4/>.

If you are not a part of a fairly large, distributed network or don't have a
laptop which needs to dynamically reconfigure to the local network, you
probably do not need an automounter.
