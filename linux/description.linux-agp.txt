/dev/agpgart (AGP Support)

AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to connect graphics
cards to the rest of the system.

If you have an AGP system, it will be possible to use the AGP features of your
3D rendering video card. This code acts as a sort of "AGP driver" for the
motherboard's chipset.

If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
(theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB due to Kernel
allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses and have up to a couple gigs of
texture space.

Note that this is the only means to have X/GLX use write-combining with MTRR
support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL direct rendering will be a lot
slower but still faster than PIO.

You should use this module if you want to use GLX or DRI.

  * ali-agp: ALI chipset support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X on the
    following ALi chipsets. The supported chipsets include M1541, M1621, M1631,
    M1632, M1641,M1647,and M1651. For the ALi-chipset question, ALi suggests
    you refer to <http://www.ali.com.tw/>.
  * ati-agp: ATI chipset support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X on the ATI
    RadeonIGP family of chipsets.
  * amd-k7-agp: AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 chipset support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X on AMD
    Irongate, 761, and 762 chipsets.
  * amd64-agp: AMD Opteron/Athlon64 on-CPU GART support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X using the
    on-CPU northbridge of the AMD Athlon64/Opteron CPUs. You still need an
    external AGP bridge like the AMD 8151, VIA K8T400M, SiS755. It may also
    support other AGP bridges when loaded with agp_try_unsupported=1.
  * intel-agp, intel-gtt: Intel 440LX/BX/GX, I8xx and E7x05 chipset support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X on Intel
    440LX/BX/GX, 815, 820, 830, 840, 845, 850, 860, 875, E7205 and E7505
    chipsets and full support for the 810, 815, 830M, 845G, 852GM, 855GM, 865G
    and I915 integrated graphics chipsets.
  * nvidia-agp: NVIDIA nForce/nForce2 chipset support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X on NVIDIA
    chipsets including nForce and nForce2.
  * sis-agp: SiS chipset support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X on Silicon
    Integrated Systems [SiS] chipsets. Note that 5591/5592 AGP chipsets are NOT
    supported.
  * sworks-agp: Serverworks LE/HE chipset support.
    See <http://www.serverworks.com/> for product descriptions and images.
  * via-agp: VIA chipset support.
    This module gives you AGP support for the GLX component of X on VIA
    MVP3/Apollo Pro chipsets.
  * efficeon-agp: Transmeta Efficeon support.
    This option gives you AGP support for the Transmeta Efficeon series
    processors with integrated northbridges.
