This is **netselect**, an ultrafast intelligent parallelizing binary-search
implementation of `ping`. You give it a (possibly very long) list of servers,
and it chooses the fastest/closest one automatically. It's good for finding the
fastest mirror, the least laggy IRC server, or the best Squid neighbour.
