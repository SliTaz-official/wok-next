If you are like many computer users, you would frequently like to make changes
in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, or extract data from
parts of certain lines while discarding the rest. To write a program to do this
in a language such as C or Pascal is a time-consuming inconvenience that may
take many lines of code. The job is easy with awk, especially the GNU
implementation: gawk.

The package contains:

  * `awk` - A link to gawk
  * `gawk` - A program for manipulating text files; it is the GNU
    implementation of awk
  * `gawk-4.1.3` - A hard link to gawk
  * `igawk` - Gives gawk the ability to include files
