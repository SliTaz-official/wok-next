The ncurses library routines are a terminal-independent method of updating
character screens with reasonable optimization.

This package contains:

  * `tset` (and `reset`) - terminal initialization utility
  * `clear` - clears the terminal's screen
  * `libncursesw.so` - shared library for terminal handling
  * tabset and terminfo for common terminals
