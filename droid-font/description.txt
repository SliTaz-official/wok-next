 Droid, version 2.1
--------------------

The Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by Ascender's Steve
Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a set of system fonts for its
Android platform. The goal was to provide optimal quality and comfort on a
mobile handset when rendered in application menus, web browsers and for other
screen text. The Droid family of fonts consists of Droid Serif, Droid Sans and
Droid Sans Mono, licensed under the Apache License version 2.0, and available in
the Android Git at
http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/base.git;a=tree;f=data/fonts
as TrueType files.

This package includes the original TrueType fonts released under the Apache
License version 2.0.

Notice that this package does not support the Droid Pro family sold by Ascender.

Note, Droid was removed from the official repository:

  * [Unlist Droid fonts](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1223)
  * [rm -r apache/droid*](https://github.com/google/fonts/pull/1275)
