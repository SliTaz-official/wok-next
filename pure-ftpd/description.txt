Pure-FTPd is a fast, production-quality, standard-conformant FTP server, based
upon Troll-FTPd.

The server has been designed to be secure in default configuration, it has no
known vulnerability, it is really trivial to set up and it is especially
designed for modern kernels. It was successfully ported to Linux, FreeBSD,
DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Bitrig, OSX, AIX and iPhone.

Features include `chroot()`ed and/or virtual `chroot()`ed home directories,
virtual domains, built-in `ls`, anti-warez system, configurable ports for
passive downloads, FXP protocol, bandwidth throttling, ratios, LDAP / MySQL /
PostgreSQL-based authentication, fortune files, Apache-like log files, fast
standalone mode, text / HTML / XML real-time status report, virtual users,
virtual quotas, privilege separation, TLS and more.

### Who's using it?

Many people new to Unix are running Pure-FTPd because they find it easy to
install. But that software is also used on embedded systems and highly loaded
production servers, especially for hosting services.

For large sites with centralized user management, Pure-FTPd provides flexible
authentication schemes including SQL and LDAP backends, plus the ability to
easily write new custom handlers in any language.
