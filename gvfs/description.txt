# Virtual filesystem implementation for GIO

GVfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the I/O abstraction
of GIO (a library availible in GLib >= 2.15.1). It installs several modules that
are automatically used by applications using the APIs of libgio. There is also
FUSE support that allows applications not using GIO to access the GVfs
filesystems.

The GVfs model differs from e.g. GnomeVFS in that filesystems must be mounted
before they are used. There is a master daemon (gvfsd) that handles coordinating
mounts, and then each mount is (typically) in its own daemon process (although
mounts can share daemon process).

GVfs comes with a set of backends, including trash support, SFTP, SMB, HTTP,
DAV, and others.

GVfs also contains modules for GIO that implement volume monitors and the GNOME
URI scheme handler configuration.

There is a set of command line programs starting with "gvfs-" that lets you run
commands (like `cat`, `ls`, `stat`, etc) on files in the GVfs mounts.

command | description
--------|------------
`gvfs-cat` | concatenates the given files and prints them to the standard output
`gvfs-copy` | copies a file from one URI location to another
`gvfs-info` | shows information about the given locations
`gvfs-less` | executes less using the VFS as the input preprocesor, so less can access any resource accessible by any of the Gvfs backends
`gvfs-ls` | lists information about the given locations
`gvfs-mime` | is used to query information about applications that are registered to handle a mime-type, or set the default handler for a mime-type
`gvfs-mkdir` | creates a directory specified by an URI
`gvfs-monitor-dir` | prints information about file creation, deletion, file content and attribute changes and mount and unmount operations inside the specified directories
`gvfs-monitor-file` | prints information about creation, deletion, content and attribute changes and mount and unmount operations affecting the monitored files
`gvfs-mount` | provides commandline access to various aspects of GIOs mounting functionality
`gvfs-move` | moves a file from one URI location to another
`gvfs-open` | opens files with the default application that is registered to handle files of that type
`gvfs-rename` | changes the name of a file or directory
`gvfs-rm` | removes a file
`gvfs-save` | reads from the standard input and saves the data to the given location
`gvfs-set-attribute` | allows to set a file attribute on a file
`gvfs-trash` | sends files or directories to the "Trashcan"
`gvfs-tree` | lists the contents of the given directories recursively, in a tree-like format
