# Aufs (Advanced multi layered unification filesystem) support

Aufs is a stackable unification filesystem such as Unionfs, which unifies
several directories and provides a merged single directory.

In the early days, aufs was entirely re-designed and re-implemented Unionfs
Version 1.x series. Introducing many original ideas, approaches and
improvements, it becomes totally different from Unionfs while keeping the basic
features.
