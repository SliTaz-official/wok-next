The Findutils package contains programs to find files. These programs are
provided to recursively search through a directory tree and to create,
maintain, and search a database (often faster than the recursive find, but
unreliable if the database has not been recently updated).

The package contains:

  * `find` - Searches given directory trees for files matching the specified
    criteria
  * `locate` - Searches through a database of file names and reports the names
    that contain a given string or match a given pattern
  * `updatedb` - Updates the locate database; it scans the entire file system
    (including other file systems that are currently mounted, unless told not
    to) and puts every file name it finds into the database
  * `xargs` - Can be used to apply a given command to a list of files
