ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support

Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) support for Linux requires an
ACPI-compliant platform (hardware/firmware), and assumes the presence of
OS-directed configuration and power management (OSPM) software.

Linux ACPI provides a robust functional replacement for several legacy
configuration and power management interfaces, including the Plug-and-Play BIOS
specification (PnP BIOS), the MultiProcessor Specification (MPS), and the
Advanced Power Management (APM) specification. If both ACPI and APM support are
configured, ACPI is used.

The project home page for the Linux ACPI subsystem is here:
<https://01.org/linux-acpi>

Linux support for ACPI is based on Intel Corporation's ACPI Component
Architecture (ACPI CA). For more information on the ACPI CA, see:
<http://acpica.org/>

ACPI is an open industry specification originally co-developed by
Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Microsoft, Phoenix, and Toshiba. Currently, it is
developed by the ACPI Specification Working Group (ASWG) under the UEFI Forum
and any UEFI member can join the ASWG and contribute to the ACPI specification.
The specification is available at: <http://www.acpi.info>
