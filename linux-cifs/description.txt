CIFS support (advanced network filesystem, SMBFS successor)

This is the client VFS module for the Common Internet File System (CIFS)
protocol which is the successor to the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, the
native file sharing mechanism for most early PC operating systems. The CIFS
protocol is fully supported by file servers such as Windows 2000 (including
Windows 2003, Windows 2008, NT 4 and Windows XP) as well by Samba (which
provides excellent CIFS server support for Linux and many other operating
systems). Limited support for OS/2 and Windows ME and similar servers is
provided as well.

The module also provides optional support for the followon protocols for CIFS
including SMB3, which enables useful performance and security features.

The cifs module provides an advanced network file system client for mounting to
CIFS compliant servers. It includes support for DFS (hierarchical name space),
secure per-user session establishment via Kerberos or NTLM or NTLMv2, safe
distributed caching (oplock), optional packet signing, Unicode and other
internationalization improvements.

Use this module if you need to mount to Samba or Windows from your machine.
