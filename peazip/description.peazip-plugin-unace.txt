### UNACE Plugin

UNACE Plugin handles browsing and extraction of WinAce's
[ACE file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_%28compression_file_format%29)
and it is needed to
[open ACE files](http://www.peazip.org/ace-files-utility.html) in PeaZip.

This package is meant to provide free ACE files support as separate plugin
since UNACE is released by WinACE as royalty free, but closed source, freeware
binaries.

Note for GNU/Linux users: UNACE is a 32 bit executable, so on Linux 64 bit
systems it requires ia32-libs to extract ACE files.
