### Additional Formats Plugin 2

PeaZip Additional Formats Plugin 2 is needed to handle additional formats
supported by PeaZip: LPAQ1, LPAQ5, PAQ8F, PAQ8JD, PAQ8L, QUAD and BALZ
(browsing and extraction).

Note for GNU/Linux users: contains 32 bit x86 executable software, so on Linux
64 bit systems it requires **ia32-libs**.
