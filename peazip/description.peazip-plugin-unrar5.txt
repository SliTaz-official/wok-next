### UNRAR5 Plugin (optional, alternative unrar engine)

On Windows and Linux systems recent PeaZip versions use by default the 7-Zip /
p7zip 15.06 (or more recent) unrar implementation, which is capable of reading
(browsing, extracting) RAR5 format natively, so **it is no longer needed to
separately install this plugin** - which it is still provided only as an
alternative rar5 files extraction engine.

UNRAR5 Plugin is meant to [open RAR files](http://www.peazip.org/free-rar.html)
built with most recent [RARv5rar5](http://www.rarlab.com/technote.htm) format
standard file format specifications.

RarLab's unrar is royalty-free, and sources are available, but due to unrar
[licensing restrictionis](http://www.scribd.com/doc/45654333/UnRAR-License#scribd)
(licensing terms of source code prohibits making a tool that can create
RAR-compatible archives) it is widely regarded
([Fedora project on unrar](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Unrar?rd=Licensing/Unrar),
[Ubuntu forums unrar](http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-2012979.html))
by Open Source community to not be OSI-compliant - and consequently needs to be
deployed as separate add-on for PeaZip project.
