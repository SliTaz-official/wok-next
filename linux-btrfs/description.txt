Btrfs is a general purpose copy-on-write filesystem with extents, writable
snapshotting, support for multiple devices and many more features focused on
fault tolerance, repair and easy administration.

The filesystem disk format is no longer unstable, and it's not expected to
change unless there are strong reasons to do so. If there is a format change,
file systems with a unchanged format will continue to be mountable and usable
by newer kernels.
