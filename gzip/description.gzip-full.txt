  * `gunzip` - decompresses gzipped files
  * `gzexe` - creates self-decompressing executable files
  * `gzip` - compresses the given files using Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) coding
  * `uncompress` - decompresses compressed files
  * `zcat` - decompresses the given gzipped files to standard output
  * `zcmp` - runs `cmp` on gzipped files
  * `zdiff` - runs `diff` on gzipped files
  * `zegrep` - runs `egrep` on gzipped files
  * `zfgrep` - runs `fgrep` on gzipped files
  * `zforce` - forces a `.gz` extension on all given files that are gzipped
    files, so that `gzip` will not compress them again; this can be useful when
    file names were truncated during a file transfer
  * `zgrep` - runs `grep` on gzipped files
  * `zless` - runs `less` on gzipped files
  * `zmore` - runs `more` on gzipped files
  * `znew` - re-compresses files from `compress` format to `gzip` format -
    `.Z` to `.gz`
