Attempt to replace default stock icons with the icons from the currently used
icon theme (paper-icon-theme) will allow to slim down the icon theme removing
these icons from there leaving them only inside gtk.

To try:

  1. Add to BUILD_DEPENDS:
     * paper-icon-theme
     * rsvg-convert
     * optipng-static
     * pngquant-static
     * symlinks
     * automake
  2. Call the script in the beginning of compile_rules():
     . $stuff/replace-icons-paper
     cd $src
  3. Regenerate the sources using:
     autoreconf -fi
  4. Then, as usual, configure - make - make install
