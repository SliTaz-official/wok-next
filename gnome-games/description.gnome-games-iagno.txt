Iagno is the two player strategy game of Othello, which is also known as
Reversi and is similar to Go. The pieces are tiles that are black on one side
and white on the other and the objective is for the player to flip his/her
opponent's tiles to his/her color, while keeping the opponent from doing the
same. Once the board is filled with tiles, the winner is the player with the
most of his/her color tiles on the board.
