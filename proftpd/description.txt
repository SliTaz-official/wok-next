ProFTPD is a highly configurable FTP daemon for Unix and Unix-like operating
systems.

ProFTPD grew from a desire for a secure and configurable FTP server. It was
inspired by a significant admiration of the Apache web server. Unlike most
other Unix FTP servers, it has not been derived from the old BSD `ftpd` code
base, but is a completely new design and implementation.

ProFTPD's extensive configurability provides systems administrators great
flexibility in user authentication and access controls, including virtual users
and easy `chroot()` FTP sessions for individual users.

ProFTPD is popular with many service providers for delivering update access to
user web pages, without resorting to Unix shell accounts.

Major Features
--------------

  - A single main configuration file, with directives and directive groups
    patterned after those of the Apache web server
  - Per directory ".ftpaccess" configuration similar to Apache's ".htaccess"
  - Designed to run either as a stand-alone server or from `inetd`/`xinetd`
  - Multiple virtual FTP servers and anonymous FTP services
  - Multiple password files
  - Shadow password support, including support for expired accounts
  - Multiple authentication methods, including PAM, LDAP, SQL, and RADIUS
  - Virtual users
  - ProFTPD never executes any external program at any time. There is no
    `SITE EXEC` command, and all file and directory listings are generated
    internally, without using an external ls command
  - Anonymous FTP and other chroot directories do not require any specific
    directory structure, executable programs or other system files
  - Modular architecture with an API that facilitates well structured
    extensions to meet user needs
  - Visibility of directories or files controlled based on Unix style
    permissions or user/group ownership
  - Logging and utmp/wtmp support. Logging is compatible with `wu-ftpd`, and
    extended, customizable logging is available
  - If supported by the capabilities the host system, it can run as a
    non-privileged user in stand-alone mode, thwarting attacks aimed at
    exploiting "root" privileges
  - GPLv2 source license. The source code is available to audit
