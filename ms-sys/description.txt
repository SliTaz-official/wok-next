This program is used to create Microsoft compatible boot records. It is able to
do the same as Microsoft "`fdisk /mbr`" to a hard disk. It is also able to do
the same as Microsoft "`sys d:`" to a floppy or FAT partition except that it
does not copy any system files, only the boot record is written.

Specifications of boot records is taken from
http://www.geocities.com/thestarman3/asm/mbr/MBR_in_detail.htm

The program is useful when using Linux to restore a backup of a reference
Microsoft Windows installation.

Author of this program is Henrik Carlqvist <henca@users.SourceForge.net>, it
is available for download from http://ms-sys.sourceforge.net/

## Examples

Please note that Windows ME is not useful for making standalone bootable
floppies. However, Win9x and DOS works fine with example 1 and example 3.

### Example 1, creating a 1.68 MB bootable floppy:

This example assumes that you have your windows installation mounted at /dosc
and also have mtools and fdformat installed.

```
fdformat /dev/fd0u1680
mformat a:
ms-sys -w /dev/fd0
mcopy /dosc/io.sys a:
mcopy /dosc/msdos.sys a:
mcopy /dosc/command.com a:
```

### Example 2, restoring a backup to a fresh hard disk:

  * Step 1, use GNU parted to create your FAT32 partition and file system:

    ```
    parted
    ```

    (then create partition and file system)

  * Step 2, write the MBR:

    ```
    ms-sys -w /dev/hda
    ```

  * Step 3, write the FAT32 partition boot record:

    ```
    ms-sys -w /dev/hda1
    ```

  * Step 3b, write partition info and drive id to partition:

    ```
    ms-sys -p /dev/hda1
    ```

    This step might be needed depending on which program was used to format the
    partition. If the program was formatted with gnu parted this step could be
    skipped. It is also possible to combine this flag with the previous step
    like this:

     ```
     ms-sys -wp /dev/hda1
     ```

  * Step 4, mount your new filesystem:

    ```
    mount /dev/hda1 /mnt
    ```

  * Step 5, read your backup

    ```
    cd /mnt; tar -xzvf /path/to/my_windows_backup_file.tgz
    ```


### Example 3, creating a bootable 2.8 MB floppy image for use with an el-torito bootable CD:

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy288.img bs=1024 count=2880
/sbin/mkdosfs floppy288.img
ms-sys -1 -f floppy288.img
su
mount -o loop floppy288.img /mnt
cp msdos.sys /mnt/
cp io.sys /mnt/
cp command.com /mnt/
```

(it might also be a good idea to add a config.sys and autoexec.bat with CDROM
support)

```
umount /mnt
exit
cp floppy288.img cd-files/eltorito.img
mkisofs -b eltorito.img -c eltorito.cat -o cdimage.iso cd-files
```

(burn the file cdimage.iso to a CD with cdrecord or another program)
