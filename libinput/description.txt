libinput
--------

libinput is a library to handle input devices in Wayland compositors and to
provide a generic X.Org input driver. It provides device detection, device
handling, input device event processing and abstraction so minimize the amount
of custom input code compositors need to provide the common set of
functionality that users expect.


X.Org libinput driver
---------------------

The X.Org libinput driver is a thin wrapper around libinput and allows for
libinput to be used for input devices in X. This driver can be used as as
drop-in replacement for evdev and synaptics. Simply build and install in your
$PREFIX, then install the config file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/. Restart X and
the libinput driver will take over your devices.
