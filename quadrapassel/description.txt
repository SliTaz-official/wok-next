In Quadrapassel, the GNOME version of Tetris, your goal is to create as many
complete horizontal lines as possible. The lines are made from seven different
shapes. The shapes fall randomly from the top center of the screen. Your task
is to rotate and move the shapes across the screen to make complete lines. By
making complete horizontal lines, you score points and move up levels. As you
progress, the speed of the falling blocks increases.
