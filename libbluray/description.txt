`libbluray` is an **open-source** library designed for Blu-Ray Discs playback
for media players, like [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) or MPlayer.

This **research** project is developed by an international team of developers
from [Doom9](http://www.doom9.org/).

Features

  * Portability: Currently supported platforms are GNU/Linux, Windows, MacOS X.
    Dependencies are very limited.
  * Freedom: `libbluray` is released under a Free Software license, LGPL,
    ensuring it will stay free.
  * Features: the library integrates navigation, playlist parsing, menus and
    BD-J.
  * Legal: libbluray is DRM-circumvention free, and thus, safe to integrate in
    your software.
  * Fun: libbluray is a fun to hack on project, in its starting phase.

**NB:** Most commercial Blu-Ray are protected by [AACS](http://www.aacsla.com/)
or [BD+](http://www.bdplusllc.com/) technologies and this library is not enough
to playback those discs.

People interested in AACS technologies should have a look at

People interested in BD+ technologies should have a look at
[libbdplus](http://www.videolan.org/developers/libbdplus.html).
