libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2,
NEON, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on
x86, x86-64, ARM, and PowerPC systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is
generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. On other types of
systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform libjpeg by a significant amount,
by virtue of its highly-optimized Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the
performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

libjpeg-turbo implements both the traditional libjpeg API as well as the less
powerful but more straightforward TurboJPEG API. libjpeg-turbo also features
colorspace extensions that allow it to compress from/decompress to 32-bit and
big-endian pixel buffers (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), as well as a full-featured Java
interface.

Features

  * 2-6x as fast as libjpeg on x86, x86-64, and ARM platforms
  * 32-bit and 64-bit binaries provided for popular Linux distributions,
    Windows, OS X, and iOS
  * Can be used in GPL and proprietary applications
  * Provides the industry-standard libjpeg API/ABI (can emulate libjpeg v6b,
    v7, or v8, although libjpeg-turbo does not support the non-standard
    SmartScale format introduced in libjpeg v8)
  * Provides the TurboJPEG API used by VirtualGL and TurboVNC
  * Similar performance to commercial/closed source accelerated JPEG codecs
  * Full-featured Java wrapper
