The command line tools are all gathered into one umbrella command: `mutool`.

For rendering and converting documents there are three commands available:

  * `mutool draw`: This is the more customizable tool, but also has a more
    difficult set of command line options. It is primarily used for rendering
    a document to image files.
  * `mutool convert`: This tool is used for converting documents into other
    formats, and is easier to use.
  * `mutool trace`: This is a debugging tool used for printing a trace of the
    graphics device calls on a page.

There are also several tools specifically for working with PDF files:

  * `mutool show`: A tool for displaying the internal objects in a PDF file.
  * `mutool extract`: Extract images and embedded font resources.
  * `mutool clean`: Rewrite PDF file. Used to fix broken files, or to make
    a PDF file human editable.
  * `mutool merge`: Merge pages from multiple input files into a new PDF.
  * `mutool create`: Create a new PDF file from a text file with graphics
    commands.
  * `mutool portfolio`: Manipulate PDF portfolios.

And finally, there is a tool for doing anything you can imagine:

  * `mutool run`: A tool for running Javascript programs with access to the
    MuPDF library functions.
