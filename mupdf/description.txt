MuPDF is an open source software framework for viewing and converting PDF, XPS,
and E-book documents. There are viewers for various platforms, several command
line tools, and a software library for building tools and applications.

Viewers
-------

For Linux and Windows there are two viewers. One is a very basic viewer using
x11 and win32, respectively. It has been supplanted by a newer viewer using
OpenGL for rendering, which has more features such as table of contents,
unicode search, etc. We keep the old viewers around for older systems where
OpenGL is not available.
