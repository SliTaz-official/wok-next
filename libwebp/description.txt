WebP is an image format that uses either the VP8 key frame encoding to compress
image data in a lossy way, or the WebP lossless encoding (and possibly other
encodings in the future). These encoding schemes should make it more efficient
than currently used formats. It is optimized for fast image transfer over the
network (e.g., for websites). The WebP format has feature parity (color
profile, metadata, animation, etc.) with other formats as well.
