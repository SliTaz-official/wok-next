liboping – Library to ping IPv4 and IPv6 hosts in parallel

liboping was inspired by ping, libping and fping: It differs from these
existing solutions in that it can “ping” multiple hosts in parallel using IPv4
or IPv6 transparently. Other design principles were an object oriented
interface, simplicity and extensibility.

On top of liboping two command line applications have been built. “oping” is a
drop-in replacement for ping(1) with very similar output. “noping” is an
ncurses-based application which displays statistics while pinging and
highlights aberrant round-trip times.
