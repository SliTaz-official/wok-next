The Speex is a patent-free, Open Source/Free Software voice codec. Unlike other
codecs like MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, Speex is designed to compress voice at bitrates
in the 2-45 kbps range. Possible applications include VoIP, internet audio
streaming, archiving of speech data (e.g. voice mail), and audio books. In some
sense, it is meant to be complementary to the Ogg Vorbis codec.

To use the Speex command line tools:

```
% speexenc [options] input_file.wav compressed_file.spx

% speexdec [options] compressed_file.spx output_file.wav
```

The Speex codec has been obsoleted by [Opus](http://opus-codec.org/). It will
continue to be available, but since Opus is better than Speex in all aspects,
users are encouraged to switch.
