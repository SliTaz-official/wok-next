Features
--------

  * Wu64 quantization for true-color files
  * Flexible options for transparency handling
  * CLI and GUI versions available
  * OS-independent source code is under zlib license

Usage
-----

    apng2gif anim.png [anim.gif] [-t tlevel] [-b bcolor]

Options
-------

  * -t 128 : will set the transparency threshold level as 128, so pixels with
    alpha level less than 128 will become fully transparent.
  * -b "#ff0000" -b 255 0 0 : will set the background color as red, so
    partially transparent pixels will be composed over red.
    When -b is used, -t is ignored.

When no options are specified, default threshold is 128, no background color.
