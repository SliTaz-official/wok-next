The Diffutils package contains programs that show the differences between files
or directories.

The package contains:

  * `cmp` - Compares two files and reports whether or in which bytes they
    differ
  * `diff` - Compares two files or directories and reports which lines in the
    files differ
  * `diff3` - Compares three files line by line
  * `sdiff` - Merges two files and interactively outputs the results
