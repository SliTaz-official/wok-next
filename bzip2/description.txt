bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It
typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being around
twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression.

This package contains:

  * `bzip2` - Compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text
    compression algorithm with Huffman coding; the compression rate is better
    than that achieved by more conventional compressors using "Lempel-Ziv"
    algorithms, like gzip
  * `bunzip2` - Decompresses bzipped files
  * `bzcat` - Decompresses to standard output
