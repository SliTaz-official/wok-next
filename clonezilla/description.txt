Clonezilla, based on DRBL, partclone, and udpcast, allows you to do bare metal
backup and recovery. Two types of Clonezilla are available, Clonezilla live and
Clonezilla SE (Server Edition). Clonezilla live is suitable for single machine
backup and restore. While Clonezilla SE is for massive deployment, it can clone
many (40 plus!) computers simultaneously.
